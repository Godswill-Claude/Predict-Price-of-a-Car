# Predict-Price-of-a-Car
This project employs Gradient Boosting algorithm to predict car prices based on features such as brand, mileage, and year of manufacture. This is a supervised regression ML task.

Gradient Boosting is another ensemble technique, but unlike Random Forest, it builds trees sequentially (hence the name “Gradient”, which means in steps). Each subsequent tree aims to correct the errors of the previous trees by minimizing a loss function (hence the name “Boosting”, that is, prediction accuracy is boosted).

Like Random Forest, Gradient Boosting can be used for supervised regression and classification problems But in this project, we will showcase a regression problem.

## Dataset Description
A synthetic regression dataset on cars was generated for this project.It includes features such as brand, mileage, and year of manufacture.

## Tools/Applications/Softwares/Packages Used for the Project
The python programming language, along with libraries such as Sci-kit learn, pandas, numpy, Seaborn and matplotlib, was used for the explorations and visualizations contained in this work.

## Key Insights for Analysis/Investigation
In this project, I endeavoured to find out the effect of features such as brand, mileage, and year of manufacture on the price of a car.

## Summary of Findings
It was was clear to observe that features such as brand, mileage, and year of manufacture of a car are all key factors determining the price of a car.
